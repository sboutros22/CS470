Customer: Vaughan (my homie), at his family ranch in Texas
Subtype: Something Fun, Something Useful, Startup Potential
Big Skills: Database, Android, Image Analysis, Data Analytics
Description:
My buddy’s family ranch is relatively small, with 40-50 head of cattle on a few dozen acres.
Ranching can be tedious work. Every cow needs routine vaccines, etc. The problem is they all look 
pretty much alike to us humans, so figuring out which cow already got what is pretty challenging. 
Lineage tracking is also pretty important, especially on a multi-species ranch, but again it’s hard to 
remember which cow is the mother of which kid. Mostly this is done (somewhat accurately) on paper. 
Larger industrial farms will tag or microchip their cows, but the process of tracking information about 
them is also usually very manual.
The app you’ll design should enable easier data collection on the status of the cows. Ideally, you should
be able to point your phone at a cow and see if it needs anything done, and who that cow’s parents are. 
For species that are all pretty much identical looking (Black Angus for example), you might support 
some fallback mechanism that’s attached to or embedded into to the cow.
Important Notes: Your frontend developers need an Android device. You may find that image analysis 
is expensive or impossible, be ready to pivot to an alternative means of identifying the cow. These cows
are ultimately food, people with an ethical obligation to the production and killing of animals should 
probably do another project.
